MariaDB-Manager-WebUI
=====================

The web user interface to the MariaDB-Manager written using Vaadin.

The interface is built on the MariaDB-Manager-API project and provides monitoring and management facilities for a MariaDB Galera Cluster. These management features include the ability to provision new nodes into the cluster, stop and start nodes within the cluster, remove nodes from the cluster for maintenance and backup the cluster data - either on-demand or via a calendar.

Other components of the MariaDB-Manager family include a monitor (MariaDB-Manager-Monitor project), the API layer (MariaDB-Manager-API), the remote execution scripts used on the Galera nodes (MariaDB-Manager-GREX) and the encompassing project (MariaDB-Manager).
